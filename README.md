# IpsumWebApp-ChristianRomeroP1


## Project Description
This is a ASP.NET Core MVC project utilizing Entity Framework Core to create a Web Store Application that allows a user to create an account then view orders by user and store location. The user can create an order, view their order history, and view the order history of a store location. The Web Store App is in the process of being publicly deployed onto Azure Web Services.

## Technologies Used:
* Entity Core Framework - for scaffolding a 3NF database that was created
* xUnit - for unit testing facets of the application
* Azure DevOps - for implementing CI/CD

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development:
* Created an ASP.NET Core MVC project using C#
* Used a Database First approach to create relevant tables and content using Microsoft SQL Server and T-SQL
* Ensured the database was constructed in 3NF 
* Created functionality for users to shop between store locations with unique inventories in a single session
* Created functionality for users to view their current order and order history

## To-do list:
* Refactor to add functionality for a unique admin account to add new locations and inventories
* Refactor to add unit testing with by using xUnit
* Refactor to establish CI/CD with an Azure Pipeline and deploy onto Azure Web Services 
* Refactor to improve user front-end style
