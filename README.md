Project Description


This is a ASP.NET Core MVC project utilizing Entity Framework Core to create a Web Store Application that allows a user to create an account then view orders by user and store location. The user can create an order, view their order history, and view the order history of a store location. The Web Store App is in the process of being publicly deployed onto Azure Web Services.

Technologies Used:


-Entity Core Framework - for scaffolding a 3NF database that was created


-xUnit - for unit testing facets of the application


-Azure DevOps - for implementing CI/CD
